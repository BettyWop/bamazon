Bamazon is an application just like any other shopping store where you can go in and see what the store offers. You may browse what they have in store and can see what their inventory is.
If there is something you would like to purchase, all you need to do is answer the questions when prompted...such as:
    1. Which item would you like to purchase?
        - You then will browse the inventory list and chose which id number based off the product you would like and input that
    2. How many would you like to buy?
        - You input how many you want to purchase
    * if you input more than what the inventory of the store has you will get a prompt that say: "Insufficient quantity! We only have (how many the store has left) left in stock."
* if you input the amount, anything equal to or lkess than what the stores has you will get notified that your purchase is complete and your total!

Have fun shopping around!!!
